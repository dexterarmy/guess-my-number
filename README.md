1. I used html , css and javascript to make this project. 
2. This project is a game where you guess a number each time your turn comes and if the guessed number matches with the randomly generated number then you get the point, in this game your aim should be to score as high as possible and try your luck and see how lucky you can get.
3. I added life to this game with javascript and making use of functionality in code like document object, querySelector to select the html element, addEventListener method to add event handler to an event , Math object and methods which are on Math object like trunc and random to generate random numbers between 1 and 20.
